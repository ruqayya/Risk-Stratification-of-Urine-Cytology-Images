<p>This repository contains code for predicting different types of cell in urine cytology images. The list of classes are: Normal urothelial cells, Squamous cells, Inflammatory, Others, Atypical urothelial cells, Malignant urothelial cells and Debris. The illustration of our proposed method for cell detection and classification from a WSI is shown in figure below.

<p>The current version of code works with jp2 whole slide images of urine cytology samples. A sample jp2 image will be downloaded if there are no images available for processing. The trained network checkpoint which was used to generate results for this study are also provided with the code.
